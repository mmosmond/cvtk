  title    = "The Linked Selection Signature of Rapid Adaptation in Temporal
              Genomic Data",
  author   = "Buffalo, Vince and Coop, Graham",
  abstract = "Populations can adapt over short, ecological timescales via
              standing genetic variation. Genomic data collected over tens of
              generations in both natural and lab populations is increasingly
              used to find selected loci underpinning such rapid adaptation.
              Although selection on large effect loci may be detectable in such
              data, often the fitness differences between individuals have a
              polygenic architecture, such that selection at any one locus
              leads to allele frequency changes that are too subtle to
              distinguish from genetic drift. However, one promising signal
              comes from the fact that selection on polygenic traits leads to
              heritable fitness backgrounds that neutral alleles can become
              stochastically associated with. These associations perturb
              neutral allele frequency trajectories, creating autocovariance
              across generations that can be directly measured from temporal
              genomic data. We develop theory that predicts the magnitude of
              these temporal autocovariances, showing that it is determined by
              the level of additive genetic variation, recombination, and
              linkage disequilibria in a region. Furthermore, by using analytic
              expressions for the temporal variances and autocovariances in
              allele frequency, we demonstrate one can estimate the additive
              genetic variation for fitness and the drift-effective population
              size from temporal genomic data. Finally, we also show how the
              proportion of total variation in allele frequency change due to
              linked selection can be estimated from temporal data. Temporal
              genomic data offers strong opportunities to identify the role
              linked selection has on genome-wide diversity over short
              timescales, and can help bridge population genetic and
              quantitative genetic studies of adaptation.",

  title     = "Genetic Drift And Estimation Of Effective Population Size",

  abstract  = "The statistical properties of the standardized variance of gene
               frequency changes (a quantity equivalent to Wright's inbreeding
               coefficient) in a random mating population are studied, and new
               formulae for estimating the effective population size are
               developed. The accuracy of the formulae depends on the ratio of
               sample size to effective size, the number of generations
               involved ( t ), and the number of loci or alleles used. It is
               shown that the standardized variance approximately follows the
               $X$2 distribution unless t is very large, and the confidence
               interval of the estimate of effective size can be obtained by
               using this property. Application of the formulae to data from an
               isolated population of Dacus oleae has shown that the effective

               under continued selection are obtained that include the
               possibility of partial full-sib mating and other systems such as
               assortative mating. The general equation for the case of equal
               number of sexes and constant number of breeding individuals (N)
               is Ne = 4N/[2(1 - alpha I) + (Sk2 + 4Q2C2) (1 + alpha I + 2
               alpha O)], where Sk2 is the variance of family size due to
               sampling without selection, C2 is the variance of selective
               advantages among families (the squared coefficient of variation
               of the expected number of offspring per family), alpha I is the
               deviation from Hardy-Weinberg proportions, alpha O is the
               correlation between genes of male and female parents, and Q2 is
               the term accounting for the cumulative effect of selection on an
               inherited trait. This is obtained as Q = 2/[2 - G(1 + r)], where
               G is the remaining proportion of genetic variance in selected
               individuals and r is the correlation of the expected selective
               values of male and female parents. The method is also extended
               to the general case of different numbers of male and female
               parents. The predictive value of the formulae is tested under a
               model of truncation selection with the infinitesimal model of
               gene effects, where C2 and G are a function of the selection
               intensity, the heritability and the intraclass correlation of
               sibs. Under random mating r = alpha I = -1/(N - 1) and alpha O =
               0. Under partial full-sib mating with an average proportion beta
               of full-sib matings per generation, r approximately beta and
               alpha O approximately alpha I approximately beta/(4 - 3 beta).
               The prediction equation is compared to other approximations
               based on the long-term contributions of ancestors to
               descendants. Finally, based on the approach followed, a system
               of mating (compensatory mating) is proposed to reduce rates of
               inbreeding without loss of response in selection programs in
               which selected individuals from the largest families are mated
               to those from the smallest families.",

               (Ne) from the standardized variance in allele frequency change
               (F) is presented in a generalized form. Whereas previous
               treatments of this method have adopted rather limiting
               assumptions, the present analysis shows that the temporal method
               is generally applicable to a wide variety of organisms. Use of a
               revised model of gene sampling permits a more generalized
               interpretation of Ne than that used by some other authors
               studying this method. It is shown that two sampling plans
               (individuals for genetic analysis taken before or after
               reproduction) whose differences have been stressed by previous
               authors can be treated in a uniform way. Computer simulations
               using a wide variety of initial conditions show that different
               formulas for computing F have much less effect on Ne than do
               sample size (S), number of generations between samples (t), or
               the number of loci studied (L). Simulation results also indicate
               that (1) bias of F is small unless alleles with very low
               frequency are used; (2) precision is typically increased by
               about the same amount with a doubling of S, t, or L; (3)
               confidence intervals for Ne computed using a chi 2 approximation
               are accurate and unbiased under most conditions; (4) the
               temporal method is best suited for use with organisms having
               high juvenile mortality and, perhaps, a limited effective
               population size.",
