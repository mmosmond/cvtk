  title    = "Polygenic adaptation after a sudden change in environment",
  author   = "Hayward, Laura K and Sella, Guy",
  abstract = "Abstract Polygenic adaptation in response to selection on
              quantitative traits is thought to be ubiquitous in humans and
              other species, yet this mode of adaptation remains poorly
              understood. We investigate the dynamics of this process, assuming
              that a sudden change in environment shifts the optimal value of a
              highly polygenic quantitative trait. We find that when the shift
              is not too large relative to the genetic variance in the trait
              and this variance arises from segregating loci with small to
              moderate effect sizes (defined in terms of the selection acting
              on them before the shift), the mean phenotype's approach to the
              new optimum is well approximated by a rapid exponential process
              first described by Lande (1976). In contrast, when the shift is
              larger or large effect loci contribute substantially to genetic
              variance, the initially rapid approach is succeeded by a much
              slower one. In either case, the underlying changes to allele
              frequencies exhibit different behaviors short and long-term. Over
              the short term, strong directional selection on the trait
              introduces small differences between the frequencies of minor
              alleles whose effects are aligned with the shift in optimum
              versus those with effects in the opposite direction. The
              phenotypic effects of these differences are dominated by
              contributions from alleles with moderate and large effects, and
              cumulatively, these effects push the mean phenotype close to the
              new optimum. Over the longer term, weak directional selection on
              the trait can amplify the expected frequency differences between
              opposite alleles; however, since the mean phenotype is close to
              the new optimum, alleles are mainly affected by stabilizing
              selection on the trait. Consequently, the frequency differences
              between opposite alleles translate into small differences in
              their probabilities of fixation, and the short-term phenotypic
              contributions of large effect alleles are largely supplanted by
              contributions of fixed, moderate ones. This process takes on the
              order of ~4Ne generations (where Ne is the effective population
              size), after which the steady state architecture of genetic
              variation around the new optimum is restored.",

              have become a critical part of the toolbox of modern evolutionary
              biology. The SLiM forward genetic simulation framework is one of
              the most powerful and widely used tools in this area. However,
              its foundation in the Wright-Fisher model has been found to pose
              an obstacle to implementing many types of models; it is difficult
              to adapt the Wright-Fisher model, with its many assumptions, to
              modeling ecologically realistic scenarios such as explicit space,
              overlapping generations, individual variation in reproduction,
              density-dependent population regulation, individual variation in

              contains two key advancements aimed at abolishing these
              limitations. First, the new non-Wright-Fisher or ``nonWF'' model
              type provides a much more flexible foundation that allows the
              easy implementation of all of the above scenarios and many more.
              Second, SLiM 3 adds support for continuous space, including
              spatial interactions and spatial maps of environmental variables.
              We provide a conceptual overview of these new features, and
              present several example models to illustrate their use.",

              amino acid divergence between species of Drosophila was fixed by
              positive selection, using statistical approaches based on the
              McDonald-Kreitman test. However, little is known about associated
              selection coefficients of beneficial amino acid mutations.
              Recurrent selective sweeps associated with adaptive substitutions
              should leave a characteristic signature in genome variability
              data that contains information about the frequency and strength
              of selection. Here, I document a significant negative correlation
              between the level and the frequency of synonymous site
              polymorphism and the rate of protein evolution in highly
              recombining regions of the X chromosome of D. melanogaster. This
              pattern is predicted by recurrent adaptive protein evolution and
              suggests that adaptation is an important determinant of patterns
              of neutral variation genome-wide. Using a maximum likelihood
              approach, I estimate the product of the rate and strength of
              selection under a recurrent genetic hitchhiking model,
              lambda2N(e)s approximately 3 x 10(-8). Using an approach based on
              the McDonald-Kreitman test, I estimate that approximately 50\% of
              divergent amino acids were driven to fixation by positive
              selection, implying that beneficial amino acid substitutions are
              of weak effect on average, on the order of 10(-5) (i.e., 2N(e)s
              approximately 40). Two implications of these results are that
              most adaptive substitutions will be difficult to detect in genome
              scans of selection and that population size (and genetic drift)
              may be an important determinant of the evolutionary dynamics of
              protein adaptation.",

              heterogeneous reduction in neutral polymorphism throughout the
              genome. The pattern of reduction depends on the selective
              advantage and recurrence rate of the sweeps. Because many
              adaptive substitutions responsible for these sweeps also
              contribute to nonsynonymous divergence, the spatial distribution
              of nonsynonymous divergence also reflects the distribution of
              adaptive substitutions. Thus, the spatial correspondence between
              neutral polymorphism and nonsynonymous divergence may be
              especially informative about the process of adaptation. Here we
              study this correspondence using genomewide polymorphism data from
              Drosophila simulans and the divergence between D. simulans and D.
              melanogaster. Focusing on highly recombining portions of the
              autosomes, at a spatial scale appropriate to the study of

              the spatial correspondence between polymorphism and divergence,
              the rate and selective strength of adaptation. Our results
              independently confirm a high rate of adaptive substitution

  abstract = "Over the past four decades, the predominant view of molecular
              evolution saw little connection between natural selection and
              genome evolution, assuming that the functionally constrained
              fraction of the genome is relatively small and that adaptation is
              sufficiently infrequent to play little role in shaping patterns

              fraction of coding and noncoding differences between species are

              selection at genetically linked sites (a process called
              Background Selection, BGS). Population genetic studies, however,
              often ignore BGS effects when investigating demographic events or
              the presence of other types of selection. To obtain a more
              realistic evolutionary expectation that incorporates the
              unavoidable consequences of deleterious mutations, we generated
              high-resolution landscapes of variation across the Drosophila
              melanogaster genome under a BGS scenario independent of
              polymorphism data. We find that BGS plays a significant role in
              shaping levels of variation across the entire genome, including
              long introns and intergenic regions distant from annotated genes.
              We also find that a very large percentage of the observed
              variation in diversity across autosomes can be explained by BGS
              alone, up to 70\% across individual chromosome arms at 100-kb
              scale, thus indicating that BGS predictions can be used as
              baseline to infer additional types of selection and demographic
              events. This approach allows detecting several outlier regions
              with signal of recent adaptive events and selective sweeps. The
              use of a BGS baseline, however, is particularly appropriate to
              investigate the presence of balancing selection and our study
              exposes numerous genomic regions with the predicted signature of
              higher polymorphism than expected when a BGS context is taken
              into account. Importantly, we show that these conclusions are
              robust to the mutation and selection parameters of the BGS model.
              Finally, analyses of protein evolution together with previous
              comparisons of genetic maps between Drosophila species, suggest
              temporally variable recombination landscapes and, thus, local BGS
              effects that may differ between extant and past phases. Because
              genome-wide BGS and temporal changes in linkage effects can skew
              approaches to estimate demographic and selective events, future

              genetic basis which likely evolved via natural selection, but it
              is unclear how much the genetic correlation between these traits
              in turn impacts their capacity to evolve independently. We
              selectively bred laboratory mice for increases in tibia length
              independent of body mass, to test the hypothesis that a genetic
              correlation with body mass constrains evolutionary change in
              tibia length. RESULTS: Over 14 generations, we produced mean
              tibia length increases of 9-13\%, while mean body mass was
              unchanged, in selectively bred mice and random-bred controls.
              Using evolutionary scenarios with different selection and
              quantitative genetic parameters, we also found that this genetic
              correlation impedes the rate of evolutionary change in both
              traits, slowing increases in tibia length while preventing
              decreases in body mass, despite the latter's negative effect on
              fitness. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results from this ongoing

               positive selection, in which a mutation is favored as soon as it
               arises. This assumption may not be realistic, as environmental
               changes and range expansions may lead previously neutral or
               deleterious alleles to become beneficial. We examine what effect
               this mode of selection has on patterns of variation at linked
               neutral sites by implementing a new coalescent model of positive
               directional selection on standing variation. In this model, a
               neutral allele arises and drifts in the population, then at
               frequency f becomes beneficial, and eventually reaches fixation.
               Depending on the value of f, this scenario can lead to a large

              Theory suggests that selection at linked sites should affect
              patterns of neutral variation in partially selfing populations
              more dramatically than in outcrossing populations. However,
              empirical investigations of selection at linked sites have
              focused primarily on outcrossing species. To assess the potential
              role of selection as a determinant of neutral polymorphism in the
              context of partial self-fertilization, we conducted a
              multivariate analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
              density throughout the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis
              elegans. We based the analysis on a published SNP data set and
              partitioned the genome into windows to calculate SNP densities,
              recombination rates, and gene densities across all six
              chromosomes. Our analyses identify a strong, positive correlation
              between recombination rate and neutral polymorphism (as estimated
              by noncoding SNP density) across the genome of C. elegans.
              Furthermore, we find that levels of neutral polymorphism are
              lower in gene-dense regions than in gene-poor regions in some
              analyses. Analyses incorporating local estimates of divergence
              between C. elegans and C. briggsae indicate that a mutational
              explanation alone is unlikely to explain the observed patterns.
              Consequently, we interpret these findings as evidence that
              natural selection shapes genome-wide patterns of neutral
              polymorphism in C. elegans. Our study provides the first
              demonstration of such an effect in a partially selfing animal.
              Explicit models of genetic hitchhiking and background selection
              can each adequately describe the relationship between
              recombination rate and SNP density, but only when they

              genetic hitchhiking and background selection in C. elegans awaits

               controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach,
               though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach
               to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It
               calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely
               rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is
               equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is
               smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of
               the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is
               desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple
               sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the
               false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a

  abstract = "The majority of empirical population genetic studies have tried
              to understand the evolutionary processes that have shaped genetic
              variation in a single sample taken from a present-day population.
              However, genomic data collected over tens of generations in both
              natural and laboratory populations are increasingly used to find
              selected loci underpinning adaptation over these short
              timescales. Although these studies have been quite successful in
              detecting selection on large-effect loci, the fitness differences
              between individuals are often polygenic, such that selection
              leads to allele frequency changes that are difficult to
              distinguish from genetic drift. However, one promising signal
              comes from polygenic selection's effect on neutral sites that
              become stochastically associated with the genetic backgrounds
              that lead to fitness differences between individuals. Previous
              theoretical work has established that the random associations
              between a neutral allele and heritable fitness backgrounds act to
              reduce the effective population size experienced by this neutral
              allele. These associations perturb neutral allele frequency
              trajectories, creating autocovariance in the allele frequency
              changes across generations. Here, we show how temporal genomic
              data allow us to measure the temporal autocovariance in allele
              frequency changes and characterize the genome-wide impact of
              polygenic selection. We develop expressions for these temporal
              autocovariances, showing that their magnitude is determined by
              the level of additive genetic variation, recombination, and
              linkage disequilibria in a region. Furthermore, by using analytic
              expressions for the temporal variances and autocovariances in
              allele frequency, we demonstrate that one can estimate the
              additive genetic variation for fitness and the drift-effective
              population size from temporal genomic data. We also show how the
              proportion of total variation in allele frequency change due to
              linked selection can be estimated from temporal data. Overall, we
              demonstrate that temporal genomic data offer opportunities to
              identify the role of linked selection on genome-wide diversity
              over short timescales, and can help bridge population genetic and
              quantitative genetic studies of adaptation.",

              or several quantitative traits are described as the sum of a
              genetic and a non-genetic component, the first being distributed
              within families as a normal random variable centred at the
              average of the parental genetic components, and with a variance
              independent of the parental traits. Thus, the variance that
              segregates within families is not perturbed by selection, and can
              be predicted from the variance components. This does not
              necessarily imply that the trait distribution across the whole
              population should be Gaussian, and indeed selection or population
              structure may have a substantial effect on the overall trait
              distribution. One of our main aims is to identify some general
              conditions on the allelic effects for the infinitesimal model to
              be accurate. We first review the long history of the
              infinitesimal model in quantitative genetics. Then we formulate
              the model at the phenotypic level in terms of individual trait
              values and relationships between individuals, but including
              different evolutionary processes: genetic drift, recombination,
              selection, mutation, population structure, …. We give a range of
              examples of its application to evolutionary questions related to

              the current generation are indeed normally distributed with a
              variance independent of ancestral traits, up to an error of order

              contribute to local adaptation. But if most alleles contributing
              to standing variation are of small effect, how does local
              adaptation proceed? Here I review predictions of population and
              quantitative genetic models and use individual-based simulations
              to illustrate how the architecture of local adaptation depends on
              the genetic redundancy of the trait, the maintenance of standing
              genetic variation (V(G)), and the susceptibility of alleles to
              swamping. Even when population genetic models predict swamping
              for individual alleles, considerable local adaptation can evolve
              at the phenotypic level if there is sufficient V(G). However, in
              such cases the underlying architecture of divergence is
              transient: F(ST) is low across all loci, and no locus makes an
              important contribution for very long. Because this kind of local
              adaptation is mainly due to transient frequency changes and
              allelic covariances, these architectures will be difficult--if
              not impossible--to detect using current approaches to studying
              the genomic basis of adaptation. Even when alleles are large and
              resistant to swamping, architectures can be highly transient if
              genetic redundancy and mutation rates are high. These results
              suggest that drift can play a critical role in shaping the
              architecture of local adaptation, both through eroding V(G) and

              the same function and that inactivation of one of these genes has
              little or no effect on the biological phenotype. Redundancy seems
              to be widespread in genomes of higher organisms. Examples of
              apparently redundant genes come from numerous studies of
              developmental biology, immunology, neurobiology and the cell
              cycle. Yet there is a problem: genes encoding functional proteins
              must be under selection pressure. If a gene was truly redundant
              then it would not be protected against the accumulation of
              deleterious mutations. A widespread view is therefore that such
              redundancy cannot be evolutionarily stable. Here we develop a
              simple genetic model to analyse selection pressures acting on
              redundant genes. We present four cases that can explain why
              genetic redundancy is common. In three cases, redundancy is even

              evolutionary process, we know little about how it is maintained.
              Obviously, mutation-selection balance must play a role, but there
              is considerable doubt over whether it can account for
              heritabilities as high as 0.5, which are commonly found in
              natural populations. Most models of mutation-selection balance
              assume panmictic populations. In this paper we use Monte Carlo
              simulations to examine the effect of isolation by distance on the
              variation maintained by mutation in a polygenic trait subject to
              optimizing selection. We show that isolation by distance can
              substantially increase the total variation maintained in
              continuous populations over a wide range of dispersal patterns,
              but only if more than one genotype produces the optimal phenotype
              (genetic redundancy). Isolation by distance alone has only a
              slight effect on the variation maintained in the total population
              for neutral alleles. The combined effect of isolation by distance
              and genetic redundancy, however, allows the maintenance of
              substantial variation despite strong stabilizing selection. The
              mechanism is straightforward. Isolation by distance allows
              mutation and drift to operate independently in different parts of
              the population. Because of their independent evolutionary
              histories, different parts of the population independently draw
              from the available set of redundant genotypes. Because the
              genotypes are redundant, selection does not discriminate among
              them, and they will persist until eliminated by drift. The
              population as a whole maintains many distinct genotypes. We show
              that this process allows mutation to maintain high levels of
              variation, even under strong stabilizing selection, and that over
              a moderate range of dispersal patterns the amount of variation
              maintained in the entire population is independent of both the
              strength of selection and the variance of the dispersal distance.
              Furthermore, we show that individual heterozygosity is increased
              in locally mating populations when selection is strong. Finally,
              our simulations provide a rough picture of how selection and the
              dispersal pattern influence the spatial distribution of genetic
              and phenotypic variation.",

              of deleterious mutations. Recombination rates frequently vary
              along chromosomes and Drosophila melanogaster exhibits a
              remarkable pattern. Recombination rates gradually decrease
              towards centromeres and telomeres, with dramatic impact on levels
              of variation in natural populations. Two close sister species, D.
              simulans and D. mauritiana do not only have higher recombination
              rates, but also exhibit a much more homogeneous recombination
              rate that only drops sharply close to centromeres and telomeres.
              Because certain sequence motifs are associated with recombination
              rate variation in D. melanogaster, we tested whether the
              difference in recombination landscape between D. melanogaster and
              D. simulans can be explained by the genomic distribution of
              recombination-rate associated sequence motifs. We constructed the
              first high resolution recombination map for D. simulans, and
              searched for motifs linked with high recombination in both sister
              species. We identified five consensus motifs, present in either
              species. While the association between motif density and
              recombination is strong and positive in D. melanogaster, the
              results are equivocal in D. simulans. Despite the strong
              association in D. melanogaster, we do not find a decreasing
              density of these repeat motifs towards centromeres and telomeres.
              We conclude that the density of recombination-associated repeat
              motifs cannot explain the large-scale recombination landscape in
              D. melanogaster, nor the differences to D. simulans. The strong
              association seen for the sequence motifs in D. melanogaster
              likely reflects their impact influencing local differences in
              recombination rates along the genome.",

              difficulty in detecting small allele frequency changes (AFCs)
              across many contributing loci. To resolve this, we use laboratory
              natural selection to detect signatures for selective sweeps and
              polygenic adaptation. We exposed 10 replicates of a Drosophila
              simulans population to a new temperature regime and uncovered a
              polygenic architecture of an adaptive trait with high genetic
              redundancy among beneficial alleles. We observed convergent
              responses for several phenotypes-e.g., fitness, metabolic rate,

              processes. We therefore propose that rapid evolution be defined
              as a genetic change occurring rapidly enough to have a measurable
              impact on simultaneous ecological change. Using this definition
              we propose a framework for decomposing rates of ecological change
              into components driven by simultaneous evolutionary change and by
              change in a non-evolutionary factor (e.g. density dependent
              population dynamics, abiotic environmental change). Evolution is
              judged to be rapid in this ecological context if its contribution
              to ecological change is large relative to the contribution of
              other factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based
              on a theoretical predator?prey interaction [Abrams, P. \&
              Matsuda, H. (1997). Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this
              system the impact of prey evolution on predator per capita growth
              rate is 63\% that of internal ecological dynamics. We then
              propose analytical methods for measuring these contributions in
              field situations, and apply them to two long-term data sets for
              which suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both
              data sets relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been
              found when measured as character change in standard deviations
              per generation (haldanes). For Darwin's finches evolving in
              response to fluctuating rainfall [Grant, P.R. \& Grant, B.R.
              (2002). Science, 296, 707], we estimate that evolutionary change
              has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2.
              For a population of freshwater copepods whose life history
              evolves in response to fluctuating fish predation [Hairston, N.G.
              Jr \& Dillon, T.A. (1990). Evolution, 44, 1796], we find that
              evolutionary change has been about one quarter the rate of
              ecological change ? less than in the finch example, but
              nevertheless substantial. These analyses support the view that in
              order to understand temporal dynamics in ecological processes it
              is critical to consider the extent to which the attributes of the
              system under investigation are simultaneously changing as a
              result of rapid evolution.",

              been studied in the laboratory, but relatively little is known of
              fitness variation in natural environments or its causes. Lifetime
              fitness (recruitment) may be determined solely by producing many
              offspring, modified by stochastic effects on their subsequent
              survival up to the point of breeding, or by an additional
              contribution made by the high quality of the offspring owing to
              nonrandom mate choice. To investigate the determinants of
              lifetime fitness, we measured offspring production, longevity,
              and lifetime number of mates in four cohorts of two long-lived
              species of socially monogamous Darwin's finch species, Geospiza
              fortis and G. scandens, on the equatorial Gal{\'a}pagos Island of
              Daphne Major. Regression analysis showed that the lifetime
              production of fledglings was predicted by lifetime number of
              clutches and that recruitment was predicted by lifetime number of
              fledglings and longevity. There was little support for a
              hypothesis of selective mating by females. The offspring sired by
              extrapair mates were no more fit in terms of recruitment than
              were half-sibs sired by social mates. These findings provide
              insight into the evolution of life history strategies of tropical
              birds. Darwin's finches deviate from the standard tropical
              pattern of a slow pace of life by combining tropical (long
              lifespan) and temperate (large clutch size) characteristics. Our

              pressures (fledgling production and adult longevity) and

              suffer from confounding factors, however, such that the
              interpretation of the evidence-in particular, conclusions about
              the rate and strength of beneficial substitutions-remains
              tentative. Here, we use genome-wide polymorphism data in D.
              simulans and sequenced genomes of its close relatives to
              construct a readily interpretable characterization of the effects
              of positive selection: the shape of average neutral diversity
              around amino acid substitutions. As expected under recurrent
              selective sweeps, we find a trough in diversity levels around
              amino acid but not around synonymous substitutions, a distinctive
              pattern that is not expected under alternative models. This
              characterization is richer than previous approaches, which relied
              on limited summaries of the data (e.g., the slope of a scatter
              plot), and relates to underlying selection parameters in a
              straightforward way, allowing us to make more reliable inferences
              about the prevalence and strength of adaptation. Specifically, we
              develop a coalescent-based model for the shape of the entire
              curve and use it to infer adaptive parameters by maximum
              likelihood. Our inference suggests that ∼13\% of amino acid
              substitutions cause selective sweeps. Interestingly, it reveals
              two classes of beneficial fixations: a minority (approximately
              3\%) that appears to have had large selective effects and
              accounts for most of the reduction in diversity, and the
              remaining 10\%, which seem to have had very weak selective
              effects. These estimates therefore help to reconcile the apparent
              conflict among previously published estimates of the strength of
              selection. More generally, our findings provide unequivocal
              evidence for strongly beneficial substitutions in Drosophila and

  abstract = "The use of genetic polymorphism data to understand the dynamics
              of adaptation and identify the loci that are involved has become
              a major pursuit of modern evolutionary genetics. In addition to
              the classical ``hard sweep'' hitchhiking model, recent research
              has drawn attention to the fact that the dynamics of adaptation
              can play out in a variety of different ways and that the specific
              signatures left behind in population genetic data may depend
              somewhat strongly on these dynamics. One particular model for
              which a large number of empirical examples are already known is
              that in which a single derived mutation arises and drifts to some
              low frequency before an environmental change causes the allele to
              become beneficial and sweeps to fixation. Here, we pursue an
              analytical investigation of this model, bolstered and extended
              via simulation study. We use coalescent theory to develop an
              analytical approximation for the effect of a sweep from standing
              variation on the genealogy at the locus of the selected allele
              and sites tightly linked to it. We show that the distribution of
              haplotypes that the selected allele is present on at the time of
              the environmental change can be approximated by considering
              recombinant haplotypes as alleles in the infinite-alleles model.
              We show that this approximation can be leveraged to make accurate
              predictions regarding patterns of genetic polymorphism following
              such a sweep. We then use simulations to highlight which sources
              of haplotypic information are likely to be most useful in
              distinguishing this model from neutrality, as well as from other
              sweep models, such as the classic hard sweep and
              multiple-mutation soft sweeps. We find that in general,
              adaptation from a unique standing variant will likely be
              difficult to detect on the basis of genetic polymorphism data
              from a single population time point alone, and when it can be
              detected, it will be difficult to distinguish from other
              varieties of selective sweeps. Samples from multiple populations
              and/or time points have the potential to ease this difficulty.",

  title    = "Commentary: Fisher's infinitesimal model: A story for the ages",
  author   = "Turelli, Michael",
  abstract = "Mendel (1866) suggested that if many heritable ``factors''
              contribute to a trait, near-continuous variation could result.
              Fisher (1918) clarified the connection between Mendelian
              inheritance and continuous trait variation by assuming many loci,
              each with small effect, and by informally invoking the central
              limit theorem. Barton et al. (2017) rigorously analyze the
              approach to a multivariate Gaussian distribution of the genetic
              effects for descendants of parents who may be related. This
              commentary distinguishes three nested approximations, referred to
              as ``infinitesimal genetics,'' ``Gaussian descendants'' and
              ``Gaussian population,'' each plausibly called ``the
              infinitesimal model.'' The first and most basic is Fisher's
              ``infinitesimal'' approximation of the underlying genetics -
              namely, many loci, each making a small contribution to the total
              variance. As Barton et al. (2017) show, in the limit as the
              number of loci increases (with enough additivity), the
              distribution of genotypic values for descendants approaches a
              multivariate Gaussian, whose variance-covariance structure
              depends only on the relatedness, not the phenotypes, of the
              parents (or whether their population experiences selection or
              other processes such as mutation and migration). Barton et al.
              (2017) call this rigorously defensible ``Gaussian descendants''
              approximation ``the infinitesimal model.'' However, it is widely
              assumed that Fisher's genetic assumptions yield another Gaussian
              approximation, in which the distribution of breeding values in a
              population follows a Gaussian - even if the population is subject
              to non-Gaussian selection. This third ``Gaussian population''
              approximation, is also described as the ``infinitesimal model.''
              Unlike the ``Gaussian descendants'' approximation, this third
              approximation cannot be rigorously justified, except in a
              weak-selection limit, even for a purely additive model.
              Nevertheless, it underlies the two most widely used descriptions
              of selection-induced changes in trait means and genetic
              variances, the ``breeder's equation'' and the ``Bulmer effect.''
              Future generations may understand why the ``infinitesimal model''
              provides such useful approximations in the face of epistasis,
              linkage, linkage disequilibrium and strong selection.",

               features. Neutral sequence diversity in human and ancestral

               cause a reduction in the amount of genetic variability at linked

               remain in a large population for a long period of time if it is
               maintained in gametes that are free of deleterious alleles, and
               hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population
               by selection. Approximate formulas are derived for the reduction
               below classical neutral values resulting from such background
               selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to
               fixation and loss of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity,
               and number of segregating sites. These formulas apply to
               random-mating populations with no genetic recombination, and to
               populations reproducing exclusively asexually or by
               self-fertilization. For a given selection regime and mating
               system, the reduction is an exponential function of the total
               mutation rate to deleterious mutations for the section of the
               genome involved. Simulations show that the effect decreases
               rapidly with increasing recombination frequency or rate of

               apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in fitness

               rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 +

               from 179 human genomes. As expected under a recurrent-sweep
               model, we found that diversity levels decrease near exons and
               conserved noncoding regions. In contrast to expectation,
               however, the trough in diversity around human-specific amino
               acid substitutions is no more pronounced than around synonymous
               substitutions. Moreover, relative to the genome background,
               amino acid and putative regulatory sites are not significantly
               enriched in alleles that are highly differentiated between
               populations. These findings indicate that classic sweeps were
               not a dominant mode of human adaptation over the past ~250,000

  abstract  = "The general theory of the effective size (Ne) for populations
               under directional selection is extended to cover linkage. Ne is
               a function of the association between neutral and selected genes
               generated by finite sampling. This association is reduced by
               three factors: the recombination rate, the reduction of genetic
               variance due to drift, and the reduction of genetic variance of
               the selected genes due to selection. If the genetic size of the
               genome (L in Morgans) is not extremely small the equation for Ne
               is [formula, see text] where N is the number of reproductive
               individuals, C 2 is the genetic variance for fitness scaled by
               the squared mean fitness, (1 - Z) = Vm/C2 is the rate of
               reduction of genetic variation per generation and Vm is the
               mutational input of genetic variation for fitness. The above
               predictive equation of Ne is valid for the infinitesimal model
               and for a model of detrimental mutations. The principles of the
               theory are also applicable to favorable mutation models if there
               is a continuous flux of advantageous mutations. The predictions
               are tested by simulation, and the connection with previous
               results is found and discussed. The reduction of effective size
               associated with a neutral mutation is progressive over
               generations until the asymptotic value (the above expression) is
               reached after a number of generations. The magnitude of the
               drift process is, therefore, smaller for recent neutral
               mutations than for old ones. This produces equilibrium values of
               average heterozygosity and proportion of segregating sites that
               cannot be formally predicted from the asymptotic Ne, but both
               parameters can still be predicted by following the drift along
               the lineage of genes. The spectrum of gene frequencies in a
               given generation can also be predicted by considering the
               overlapping of distributions corresponding to mutations that

               factors, especially in arid regions. Here we demonstrate the
               evolutionary response of an annual plant, Brassica rapa, to a
               recent climate fluctuation resulting in a multiyear drought.
               Ancestral (predrought) genotypes were recovered from stored seed
               and raised under a set of common environments with descendant
               (postdrought) genotypes and with ancestorxdescendant hybrids. As
               predicted, the abbreviated growing seasons caused by drought led
               to the evolution of earlier onset of flowering. Descendants
               bloomed earlier than ancestors, advancing first flowering by 1.9
               days in one study population and 8.6 days in another. The
               intermediate flowering time of ancestorxdescendant hybrids
               supports an additive genetic basis for divergence. Experiments
               confirmed that summer drought selected for early flowering, that
               flowering time was heritable, and that selection intensities in
               the field were more than sufficient to account for the observed
               evolutionary change. Natural selection for drought escape thus
               appears to have caused adaptive evolution in just a few

               reliable inference about demography, building a null model in
               scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about the dynamics
               of natural selection. Here, we introduce the first method that
               jointly infers parameters of distinct modes of linked selection,
               notably background selection and selective sweeps, from
               genome-wide diversity data, functional annotations and genetic
               maps. The central idea is to calculate the probability that a
               neutral site is polymorphic given local annotations,
               substitution patterns, and recombination rates. Information is
               then combined across sites and samples using composite
               likelihood in order to estimate genome-wide parameters of
               distinct modes of selection. In addition to parameter
               estimation, this approach yields a map of the expected neutral
               diversity levels along the genome. To illustrate the utility of
               our approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing data from
               125 lines in Drosophila melanogaster and reliably predict
               diversity levels at the 1Mb scale. Our results corroborate
               estimates of a high fraction of beneficial substitutions in
               proteins and untranslated regions (UTR). They allow us to
               distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other modes
               of selection around amino acid substitutions and to uncover
               evidence for pervasive sweeps in untranslated regions (UTRs).
               Our inference further suggests a substantial effect of other
               modes of linked selection and of adaptation in particular. More
               generally, we demonstrate that linked selection has had a larger

               to determine genotype-phenotype maps and understand adaptation
               to new environments. Despite its conceptual appeal and success
               in identifying some causative genes, it has become apparent that
               many studies suffer from an excess of candidate loci. Several
               explanations have been proposed for this phenomenon, but it is
               clear that information about the linkage structure during such
               experiments is needed. Until now only Pool-Seq (whole-genome
               sequencing of pools of individuals) data were available, which
               do not provide sufficient information about the correlation
               between linked sites. We address this problem in two
               complementary analyses of three replicate Drosophila
               melanogaster populations evolving to a new hot temperature
               environment for almost 70 generations. In the first analysis, we
               sequenced 58 haploid genomes from the founder population and
               evolved flies at generation 67. We show that during the
               experiment linkage disequilibrium (LD) increased almost
               uniformly over much greater distances than typically seen in
               Drosophila. In the second analysis, Pool-Seq time series data of
               the three replicates were combined with haplotype information
               from the founder population to follow blocks of initial
               haplotypes over time. We identified 17 selected haplotype-blocks
               that started at low frequencies in the base population and
               increased in frequency during the experiment. The size of these
               haplotype-blocks ranged from 0.082 to 4.01 Mb. Moreover, between
               42\% and 46\% of the top candidate single nucleotide
               polymorphisms from the comparison of founder and evolved
               populations fell into the genomic region covered by the
               haplotype-blocks. We conclude that LD in such rising
               haplotype-blocks results in long range hitchhiking over multiple
               kilobase-sized regions. LD in such haplotype-blocks is therefore
               a major factor contributing to an excess of candidate loci.
               Although modifications of the experimental design may help to
               reduce the hitchhiking effect and allow for more precise mapping
               of causative variants, we also note that such haplotype-blocks

               Mendelian sampling of genes of ancestors in a given generation
               to the relationship between individuals in later generations.
               These contributions stabilize with time and the value to which
               they stabilize is shown to be related to the asymptotic rate of
               inbreeding and therefore also the effective population size, Ne
               approximately 2N/(mu 2r + sigma 2r), where N is the number of
               individuals per generation and mu r and sigma 2r are the mean
               and variance of long-term relationships or long-term
               contributions. These stabilized values are then predicted using
               a recursive equation via the concept of selective advantage for
               populations with hierarchical mating structures undergoing mass
               selection. Account is taken of the change in genetic parameters
               as a consequence of selection and also the increasing
               'competitiveness' of contemporaries as selection proceeds.
               Examples are given and predicted rates of inbreeding are

               20 males and 20, 40, 100 or 200 females the rate of inbreeding

               properties: Additional to sampling individuals, sequencing DNA
               in pools leads to a second round of sampling, which increases

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Selection signatures aim to identify genomic regions
               underlying recent adaptations in populations. However, the
               effects of selection in the genome are difficult to distinguish
               from random processes, such as genetic drift. Often associations
               between selection signatures and selected variants for complex
               traits is assumed even though this is rarely (if ever) tested.
               In this paper, we use 8 breeds of domestic cattle under strong
               artificial selection to investigate if selection signatures are
               co-located in genomic regions which are likely to be under
               selection. RESULTS: Our approaches to identify selection
               signatures (haplotype heterozygosity, integrated haplotype score
               and FST) identified strong and recent selection near many loci
               with mutations affecting simple traits under strong selection,
               such as coat colour. However, there was little evidence for a
               genome-wide association between strong selection signatures and
               regions affecting complex traits under selection, such as milk
               yield in dairy cattle. Even identifying selection signatures
               near some major loci was hindered by factors including allelic
               heterogeneity, selection for ancestral alleles and interactions
               with nearby selected loci. CONCLUSIONS: Selection signatures
               detect loci with large effects under strong selection. However,
               the methodology is often assumed to also detect loci affecting
               complex traits where the selection pressure at an individual
               locus is weak. We present empirical evidence to suggests little
               discernible 'selection signature' for complex traits in the

               polygenic system in which all genetic effects are additive

               assumptions are made about the distribution of breeding values

               microevolution in the wild, with particular regard to studies of
               contemporary, often deemed ``rapid,'' evolution. A considerable
               amount of ambiguity and inconsistency persists within the field,
               and we provide a number of suggestions that should improve study
               design, inference, and clarity of presentation. (1) Some studies
               measure change over time within a population (allochronic) and
               others measure the difference between two populations that had a
               common ancestor in the past (synchronic). Allochronic studies
               can be used to estimate rates of ``evolution,'' whereas
               synchronic studies more appropriately estimate rates of
               ``divergence.'' Rates of divergence may range from a small
               fraction to many times the actual evolutionary rates in the
               component populations. (2) Some studies measure change using
               individuals captured from the wild, whereas others measure
               differences after rearing in a common environment. The first
               type of study can be used to specify ``phenotypic'' rates and
               the later ``genetic'' rates. (3) The most commonly used
               evolutionary rate metric, the darwin, has a number of
               theoretical shortcomings. Studies of microevolution would
               benefit from specifying rates in standard deviations per
               generation, the haldane. (4) Evolutionary rates are typically
               specified without an indication of their precision. Readily
               available methods for specifying confidence intervals and
               statistical significance (regression, bootstrapping,
               randomization) should be implemented. (5) Microevolutionists
               should strive to accumulate time series, which can reveal
               temporal shifts in the rate of evolution and can be used to
               identify evolutionary patterns. (6) Evolutionary rates provide a
               convenient way to compare the tempo of evolution across studies,
               traits, taxa, and time scales, but such comparisons are subject
               to varying degrees of confidence. Comparisons across different
               time scales are particularly tenuous. (7) A number of
               multivariate rate measures exist, but considerable theoretical
               development is required before their utility can be determined.
               We encourage the continued investigation of evolutionary rates
               because the information they provide is relevant to a wide range
               of theoretical and practical issues.",

               generate this pattern, and the relative importance of these
               alternative possibilities remains unresolved generally. Here we
               quantify nucleotide differences within populations, between
               populations, and between species to test for genome-wide effects
               of selection and RAM in the partially selfing nematode
               Caenorhabditis briggsae. We find that nearly half of genome-wide
               variation in nucleotide polymorphism is explained by differences
               in local recombination rates. By quantifying divergence between
               several reproductively isolated lineages, we demonstrate that

               amount of neutral polymorphisms within a species will increase
               proportionally with the census population size (Nc). However,
               this prediction has not been borne out in practice: while the
               range of Nc spans many orders of magnitude, levels of genetic
               diversity within species fall in a comparatively narrow range.
               Although theoretical arguments have invoked the increased
               efficacy of natural selection in larger populations to explain
               this discrepancy, few direct empirical tests of this hypothesis
               have been conducted. In this work, we provide a direct test of
               this hypothesis using population genomic data from a wide range
               of taxonomically diverse species. To do this, we relied on the
               fact that the impact of natural selection on linked neutral
               diversity depends on the local recombinational environment. In
               regions of relatively low recombination, selected variants
               affect more neutral sites through linkage, and the resulting
               correlation between recombination and polymorphism allows a
               quantitative assessment of the magnitude of the impact of
               selection on linked neutral diversity. By comparing whole genome
               polymorphism data and genetic maps using a coalescent modeling

               reduces linked neutral diversity for 40 species of obligately
               sexual eukaryotes. We then show that the magnitude of the impact
               of natural selection is positively correlated with Nc, based on
               body size and species range as proxies for census population
               size. These results demonstrate that natural selection removes
               more variation at linked neutral sites in species with large Nc
               than those with small Nc and provides direct empirical evidence
               that natural selection constrains levels of neutral genetic
               diversity across many species. This implies that natural

               response of many quantitative trait loci drive adaptation to

               the genomic footprint of selective sweeps, the importance of
               selection on quantitative traits is still not well studied, as
               the associated genomic signature is extremely difficult to

               adaptation to a new intermediate trait optimum has three
               characteristic phases that are reflected on the genomic level:
               (1) directional frequency changes towards the new trait optimum,
               (2) plateauing of allele frequencies when the new trait optimum

  abstract  = "Two major sources of stochasticity in the dynamics of neutral
               alleles result from resampling of finite populations (genetic
               drift) and the random genetic background of nearby selected
               alleles on which the neutral alleles are found (linked
               selection). There is now good evidence that linked selection
               plays an important role in shaping polymorphism levels in a
               number of species. One of the best-investigated models of linked
               selection is the recurrent full-sweep model, in which newly
               arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk of
               selected alleles that sweep into the population may not be
               destined for rapid fixation. Here we develop a general model of
               recurrent selective sweeps in a coalescent framework, one that
               generalizes the recurrent full-sweep model to the case where
               selected alleles do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a
               large population, only the initial rapid increase of a selected
               allele affects the genealogy at partially linked sites, which
               under fairly general assumptions are unaffected by the
               subsequent fate of the selected allele. We also apply the theory
               to a simple model to investigate the impact of recurrent partial
               sweeps on levels of neutral diversity and find that for a given
               reduction in diversity, the impact of recurrent partial sweeps
               on the frequency spectrum at neutral sites is determined
               primarily by the frequencies rapidly achieved by the selected
               alleles. Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to
               low frequencies can have a profound effect on levels of
               diversity but can leave the frequency spectrum relatively
               unperturbed. In fact, the limiting coalescent model under a high

               genetic basis of natural trait variation. We could significantly
               advance this goal by developing comprehensive genome-wide
               approaches to link genotype and phenotype in model organisms.
               Here we combine artificial selection with population-based
               resequencing to investigate the genetic basis of variation in
               the interpulse interval (IPI) of Drosophila melanogaster
               courtship song. We performed divergent selection on replicate
               populations for only 14 generations, but had considerable power
               to differentiate alleles that evolved due to selection from
               those that evolved stochastically. We identified a large number
               of variants that changed frequency in response to selection for
               this simple behavior, and they are highly underrepresented on
               the X chromosome. Though our power was adequate using this
               experimental technique, the ability to differentiate causal
               variants from those affected by linked selection requires
               further development.",

  abstract  = "Experimental evolution systems allow the genomic study of
               adaptation, and so far this has been done primarily in asexual
               systems with small genomes, such as bacteria and yeast. Here we
               present whole-genome resequencing data from Drosophila
               melanogaster populations that have experienced over 600
               generations of laboratory selection for accelerated development.
               Flies in these selected populations develop from egg to adult
               ∼20\% faster than flies of ancestral control populations, and
               have evolved a number of other correlated phenotypes. On the
               basis of 688,520 intermediate-frequency, high-quality single
               nucleotide polymorphisms, we identify several dozen genomic
               regions that show strong allele frequency differentiation
               between a pooled sample of five replicate populations selected
               for accelerated development and pooled controls. On the basis of
               resequencing data from a single replicate population with
               accelerated development, as well as single nucleotide
               polymorphism data from individual flies from each replicate
               population, we infer little allele frequency differentiation
               between replicate populations within a selection treatment.
               Signatures of selection are qualitatively different than what
               has been observed in asexual species; in our sexual populations,
               adaptation is not associated with 'classic' sweeps whereby newly
               arising, unconditionally advantageous mutations become fixed.
               More parsimonious explanations include 'incomplete' sweep
               models, in which mutations have not had enough time to fix, and
               'soft' sweep models, in which selection acts on pre-existing,
               common genetic variants. We conclude that, at least for life
               history characters such as development time, unconditionally
               advantageous alleles rarely arise, are associated with small net
               fitness gains or cannot fix because selection coefficients
               change over time.",

               resistance to multiple drugs during the last the past 50 years
               has been well documented, the full genome sequence and a
               microsatellite map are now available, and haplotype data can be
               easily generated. We examined microsatellite variation around
               the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene on chromosome 4 of P.
               falciparum. Point mutations in dhfr are known to be responsible
               for resistance to the antimalarial drug pyrimethamine, and
               resistance to this drug has spread rapidly in Southeast (SE)
               Asia after its introduction in 1970s. We genotyped 33
               microsatellite markers distributed across chromosome 4 in 61
               parasites from a location on the Thailand/Myanmar border. We
               observed minimal microsatellite length variation in a 12-kb
               (0.7-cM) region flanking the dhfr gene and diminished variation
               for approximately 100 kb (6 cM), indicative of a single origin
               of resistant alleles. Furthermore, we found the same or similar
               microsatellite haplotypes flanked resistant dhfr alleles sampled
               from 11 parasite populations in five SE Asian countries
               indicating recent invasion of a single lineage of resistant dhfr
               alleles in locations 2000 km apart. Three features of these data
               are of especially interest. (1). Pyrimethamine resistance is
               generally assumed to have evolved multiple times because the
               genetic basis is simple and resistance can be selected easily in
               the laboratory. Yet our data clearly indicate a single origin of
               resistant dhfr alleles sampled over a large region of SE Asia.
               (2). The wide valley ( approximately 6 cM) of reduced variation
               around dhfr provides ``proof-of-principle'' that genome-wide
               association may be an effective way to locate genes under strong
               recent selection. (3). The width of the selective valley is
               consistent with predictions based on independent measures of
               recombination, mutation, and selection intensity, suggesting
               that we have reasonable estimates of these parameters. We
               conclude that scanning the malaria parasite genome for evidence
               of recent selection may prove an extremely effective way to
               locate genes underlying recently evolved traits such as drug
               resistance, as well as providing an opportunity to study the
               dynamics of selective events that have occurred recently or are
               currently in progress.",
