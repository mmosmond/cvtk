  abstract = "Building the connection between genetic and phenotypic variation
              is an important 'work in progress', and one that will enable
              proactive diagnosis and treatment in medicine, promote
              development of environment-targeted varieties in agriculture, and
              clarify the limits of species adaptation to changing environments
              in conservation. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and genome
              wide association (GWA) studies have recently been allied to an
              additional focus on 'hitchhiking' (HH) mapping--using changes in
              allele frequency due to artificial or natural selection. This
              older technique has been popularized by the falling costs of high
              throughput sequencing. Initial HH-resequensing experiments seem
              to have found many thousands of polymorphisms responding to
              selection. We argue that this interpretation appears too
              optimistic, and that the data might in fact be more consistent
              with dozens, rather than thousands, of loci under selection. We
              propose several developments required for sensible data analyses
              that will fully realize the great power of the HH technique, and
              outline ways of moving forward.",

              selection. Here we present a genomic dissection of the Longshanks
              selection experiment, in which mice were selectively bred over 20
              generations for longer tibiae relative to body mass, resulting in
              13\% longer tibiae in two replicates. We synthesized evolutionary
              theory, genome sequences and molecular genetics to understand the
              selection response and found that it involved both polygenic
              adaptation and discrete loci of major effect, with the strongest
              loci tending to be selected in parallel between replicates. We
              show that selection may favor de-repression of bone growth

  author   = "Buffalo, Vince and Coop, Graham",
  abstract = "Populations can adapt over short, ecological timescales via
              standing genetic variation. Genomic data collected over tens of
              generations in both natural and lab populations is increasingly
              used to find selected loci underpinning such rapid adaptation.
              Although selection on large effect loci may be detectable in such
              data, often the fitness differences between individuals have a
              polygenic architecture, such that selection at any one locus
              leads to allele frequency changes that are too subtle to
              distinguish from genetic drift. However, one promising signal
              comes from the fact that selection on polygenic traits leads to
              heritable fitness backgrounds that neutral alleles can become
              stochastically associated with. These associations perturb
              neutral allele frequency trajectories, creating autocovariance
              across generations that can be directly measured from temporal
              genomic data. We develop theory that predicts the magnitude of
              these temporal autocovariances, showing that it is determined by
              the level of additive genetic variation, recombination, and
              linkage disequilibria in a region. Furthermore, by using analytic
              expressions for the temporal variances and autocovariances in
              allele frequency, we demonstrate one can estimate the additive
              genetic variation for fitness and the drift-effective population
              size from temporal genomic data. Finally, we also show how the
              proportion of total variation in allele frequency change due to
              linked selection can be estimated from temporal data. Temporal
              genomic data offers strong opportunities to identify the role
              linked selection has on genome-wide diversity over short
              timescales, and can help bridge population genetic and
              quantitative genetic studies of adaptation.",

              to predict evolutionary responses. Most adaptive traits are
              polygenic-i.e., result from selection on a large number of
              genetic loci-but most molecularly characterized traits have a
              simple genetic basis. This discrepancy is best explained by the
              difficulty in detecting small allele frequency changes (AFCs)
              across many contributing loci. To resolve this, we use laboratory
              natural selection to detect signatures for selective sweeps and
              polygenic adaptation. We exposed 10 replicates of a Drosophila
              simulans population to a new temperature regime and uncovered a
              polygenic architecture of an adaptive trait with high genetic
              redundancy among beneficial alleles. We observed convergent
              responses for several phenotypes-e.g., fitness, metabolic rate,
              and fat content-and a strong polygenic response (99 selected
              alleles; mean s = 0.059). However, each of these selected alleles
              increased in frequency only in a subset of the evolving
              replicates. We discerned different evolutionary paradigms based
              on the heterogeneous genomic patterns among replicates.
              Redundancy and quantitative trait (QT) paradigms fitted the
              experimental data better than simulations assuming independent
              selective sweeps. Our results show that natural D. simulans
              populations harbor a vast reservoir of adaptive variation
              facilitating rapid evolutionary responses using multiple
              alternative genetic pathways converging at a new phenotypic
              optimum. This key property of beneficial alleles requires the

              the search for convergence on the molecular level.",

               based on the long-term contributions of ancestors to
               descendants. Finally, based on the approach followed, a system
